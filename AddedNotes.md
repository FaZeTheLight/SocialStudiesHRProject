##Notes to go with the project##

-Description: Thousands of children are serving as soldiers in armed conflicts around the world. These boys and girls, some as as young as 8-years-old, serve in government forces and armed opposition groups. They may fight on the front lines, participate in suicide missions, and act as spies, messengers, or lookouts. Girls may be forced into sexual slavery. Many are abducted or recruited by force, while others join out of desperation, believing that armed groups offer their best chance for survival. We are working to prevent the use of child soldiers and to hold accountable the people who send children to fight.

-Child Soilders in Syria: Non-state armed groups in Syria have used children as young as 15 to fight in battles, sometimes recruiting them under the guise of offering education, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The groups have used children as young as 14 in support roles. Extremist Islamist groups including the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training, and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions.

-Child Soilders in Afghanistan:  Insurgent groups, including the Taliban and other armed groups, use children as fighters, including in suicide attacks. The UN also reports recruitment of children by the Afghan National Police.

-Child Soilders in Burma:  Thousands of boys serve in Burma’s national army, with children as young as 11 forcibly recruited off the streets and sent into combat operations. Children also serve with some of the armed ethnic opposition groups. Read more in our report, "Sold to be Soldiers."

-Child Soilders in the Central Africa Republic: Hundreds of children, some as young as 12, serve with various rebel groups. The Lord’s Resistance Army has abducted children in the southeast of the country. 

-Child Soilders in Chad: Thousands of children have served in both government and rebel forces in Chad. In 2011 the government signed an action plan to end its use of child soldiers and recruitment has decreased sharply.

-Child Soilders in Colombia: Thousands of children—both boys and girls—serve in Colombia’s irregular armed groups. The majority serve in the FARC guerrillas, with smaller numbers in the UC-ELN guerrillas. Children are also recruited into successor groups to paramilitaries.

-Child Soilders in Sudan:  In Darfur, over a dozen armed forces and groups use child soldiers, including the Sudanese Armed Forces, pro-government militias, and factions of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army.
